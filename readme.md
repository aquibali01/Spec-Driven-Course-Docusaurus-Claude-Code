# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics  
**Spec-Driven Course | Docusaurus + Claude Code**

## Overview
This repository contains a **spec-driven technical course** on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**, focused on bridging AI systems with the physical world. The course is authored using **Spec-Kit Plus** and **Claude Code**, published with **Docusaurus**, and designed for AI and robotics engineers.

The curriculum progresses from robot middleware (ROS 2), to digital twins and simulation, to advanced perception and navigation, and finally to **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** systems powered by LLMs.

## Spec-Driven Workflow

/sp.constitution defines global rules and success criteria

/sp.specify defines module-level scope and intent

/sp.plan defines execution and validation strategy

Claude Code consumes these specs to generate consistent, auditable content.
