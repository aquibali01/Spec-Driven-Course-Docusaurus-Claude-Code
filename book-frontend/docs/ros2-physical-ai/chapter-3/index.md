# Chapter 3: Robot Modeling and Control Foundations

In this chapter, we'll explore robot modeling using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and how to connect Python AI agents to ROS 2 using rclpy. You'll learn the fundamentals of robot modeling and how to bridge AI algorithms with robot control systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand URDF fundamentals for humanoid robots
- Create basic robot models using URDF
- Link URDF models to controllers
- Implement Python AI agents that interface with ROS 2 using rclpy
- Connect AI agents to robot controllers through URDF-defined models

## Table of Contents

1. [URDF Fundamentals](./urdf-fundamentals.md) - Understanding the basics of robot description format
2. [Linking Controllers](./linking-controllers.md) - Connecting URDF models to actual controllers
3. [Python Integration](./python-integration.md) - Bridging AI agents with ROS 2 using rclpy

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this chapter, ensure you have:
- Completed Chapter 1: The Role of ROS 2 in Physical AI
- Completed Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication Primitives
- Basic understanding of XML (for URDF)
- Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with AI/ML concepts

Let's begin by exploring the fundamentals of URDF (Unified Robot Description Format).
