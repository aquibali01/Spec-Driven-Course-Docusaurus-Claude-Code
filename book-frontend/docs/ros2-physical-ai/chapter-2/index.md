# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication Primitives

In this chapter, we'll dive deep into ROS 2's communication primitives: nodes, topics, services, and actions. You'll learn how to design effective communication patterns between AI agents and robot components, and how to map AI decision loops to ROS 2 communication.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand and select appropriate ROS 2 communication primitives for different robot communication needs
- Design effective communication architectures using ROS 2 primitives
- Map AI decision loops to appropriate ROS 2 communication patterns
- Consider real-time implications when choosing communication methods

## Table of Contents

1. [Communication Primitives Overview](./nodes-topics-services.md) - Understanding nodes, topics, services, and actions
2. [Real-Time Considerations](./real-time-considerations.md) - Performance implications and timing constraints
3. [AI Decision Loops Mapping](./ai-decision-loops.md) - Connecting AI algorithms to ROS 2 communication

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this chapter, ensure you have:
- Completed Chapter 1: The Role of ROS 2 in Physical AI
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with AI/ML concepts

Let's begin by exploring the fundamental communication primitives of ROS 2.
