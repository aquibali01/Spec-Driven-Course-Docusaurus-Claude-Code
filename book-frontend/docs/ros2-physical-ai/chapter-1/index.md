# Chapter 1: The Role of ROS 2 in Physical AI

In this chapter, we'll explore ROS 2 as the foundational middleware for physical AI systems. You'll learn how ROS 2 acts as the "nervous system" of a robot, connecting AI agents with physical actuators and sensors.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain the concept of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system
- Understand the key architectural principles of ROS 2
- Articulate why ROS 2 is preferred over ROS 1 for humanoid robotics applications

## Table of Contents

1. [The Robotic Nervous System](./robotic-nervous-system.md) - Understanding ROS 2 as the communication backbone
2. [Architecture and Middleware Principles](./architecture-principles.md) - Core concepts and design patterns
3. [ROS 2 vs ROS 1 for Humanoid Robotics](./ros2-vs-ros1.md) - Key differences and advantages

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this chapter, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with AI/ML systems
- Python programming knowledge

Let's begin by exploring the concept of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system.
