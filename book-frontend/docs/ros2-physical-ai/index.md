# ROS 2 for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the ROS 2 for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics module. This educational content is designed for AI engineers and software developers transitioning into robotics and physical AI systems.

## Overview

This module introduces ROS 2 as the foundational middleware enabling communication, control, and embodiment for humanoid robots, bridging AI agents with physical actuators and sensors. You'll learn how to connect your AI expertise with physical robot control systems using the powerful ROS 2 framework.

## Learning Path

This module is organized into three comprehensive chapters:

1. [Chapter 1: The Role of ROS 2 in Physical AI](./chapter-1/index.md) - Understanding ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system
2. [Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication Primitives](./chapter-2/index.md) - Nodes, topics, services, and actions
3. [Chapter 3: Robot Modeling and Control Foundations](./chapter-3/index.md) - URDF fundamentals and Python integration

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, but can also be studied independently based on your current knowledge level.

## Target Audience

This module is specifically designed for:
- AI engineers looking to transition into robotics
- Software developers working with physical AI systems
- Anyone interested in understanding how AI agents interact with physical robots

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with software development principles

## What You'll Learn

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the concept of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system
- Understand the key architectural principles of ROS 2
- Articulate why ROS 2 is preferred over ROS 1 for humanoid robotics applications
- Understand and select appropriate ROS 2 communication primitives for different robot communication needs
- Design effective communication architectures using appropriate ROS 2 primitives
- Map AI decision loops to appropriate ROS 2 communication patterns
- Understand URDF fundamentals for humanoid robots
- Create basic robot models using URDF
- Link URDF models to controllers
- Implement Python AI agents that interface with ROS 2 using rclpy
- Connect AI agents to robot controllers through URDF-defined models

## Key Concepts Covered

### Chapter 1: The Role of ROS 2 in Physical AI

- Real-time considerations and QoS policies

### Chapter 3: Robot Modeling and Control Foundations
- URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) fundamentals
- Linking URDF models to controllers
- Python integration with rclpy
- Connecting AI agents to robot control systems

## Practical Applications

Throughout this module, you'll work with practical examples including:
- Creating basic ROS 2 nodes
- Implementing publishers and subscribers
- Setting up services and actions
- Building robot models with URDF
- Connecting AI controllers to robot systems
