# Welcome to AI-Driven Book: ROS 2 for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on ROS 2 for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This educational content is designed for AI engineers and software developers transitioning into robotics and physical AI systems.

## About This Book

This book introduces ROS 2 as the foundational middleware enabling communication, control, and embodiment for humanoid robots, bridging AI agents with physical actuators and sensors. You'll learn how to connect your AI expertise with physical robot control systems using the powerful ROS 2 framework.

## Learning Path

This book is organized into three comprehensive chapters:

1. [Chapter 1: The Role of ROS 2 in Physical AI](./ros2-physical-ai/chapter-1/index.md) - Understanding ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system
2. [Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication Primitives](./ros2-physical-ai/chapter-2/index.md) - Nodes, topics, services, and actions
3. [Chapter 3: Robot Modeling and Control Foundations](./ros2-physical-ai/chapter-3/index.md) - URDF fundamentals and Python integration

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, but can also be studied independently based on your current knowledge level.

## Target Audience

This book is specifically designed for:
- AI engineers looking to transition into robotics
- Software developers working with physical AI systems
- Anyone interested in understanding how AI agents interact with physical robots

## Prerequisites

Before starting this book, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with software development principles

## Getting Started

To get started with local development of this book:

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

Let's begin your journey into the world of ROS 2 and physical AI! Start with the [ROS 2 module](./ros2-physical-ai/index.md) to understand the foundational concepts.
